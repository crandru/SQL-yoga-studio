# Yoga Studio Database in SQL with JDBC access
SQL mock team yoga studio project involving database creation, proc/triggers, and some JDBC. The client in question desired a database to store her various Yoga business information, such as students, classes, and so forth. In addition, triggers were needed to manage aspects of refunds and high attendance, and procedures were added to simplify the addition of classes or enrollment. 

The project gave my team and I practice with basic-intermediate SQL, and introduced the use of JDBC to access the database indirectly rather than through SQLPLUS.
